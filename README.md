## How to Use:
 - The program will display a taskbar notification on startup that tells you whether or not you have assignments due that day. If you don't have any assignments due that day, it will tell you if you have any assignments due within the next 2 days. If you have any overdue assignments, the program will notify you about them if you have no other assignments due that day.
 - Right-click the program icon in the taskbar to display the context menu. From there you can choose to display the taskbar notification again, add assignments, view assignments, or close the program.
 - To delete or edit assignments, right click on one and select the desired option from the menu.
