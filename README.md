# Assignment Reminder
 Program to help me keep college work organized since my colleges website fails to do so. Works best if you have it set to run when you log into your computer.
 
## How to Use:
 - The program will display a taskbar notification on startup that tells you whether or not you have assignments due that day. If you don't have any assignments due that day, it will tell you if you have any assignments due within the next 2 days.
 - Right-click the program icon in the taskbar to display the context menu. From there you can choose to display the taskbar notification again, add assignments, view assignments, or close the program.
 - To delete a completed assignment, double click the entry for it in the assignment viewer.
 - If you want to delete all assignments at once, navigate to %AppData%/AssignmentReminder and delete the settings.xml file.
